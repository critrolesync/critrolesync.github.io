      <title>The Nautilus Ark: A Johnson Corp Odyssey | Ashley&apos;s One-Shot</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>When the last of humanity is in cryostasis on the Ark, it’s up to the intrepid crew of the Nautilus to ferry them to a fresh start on a new planet… If they can make it.</p><p>The Nautilus Ark takes inspiration from many sci-fi survival horror films, and as such, contains darker themes of isolation, body horror, and self-harm. Practice self-care and use your best judgment to step away if needed.
